- 👋 Hi, I’m @JennyMerFish
- 👀 I’m interested in camping, hiking, swimming, gardening, and coding (go figure).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code, and how to grow avocado trees.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything! I've been starved of human interaction and I'm vaxxed and ready to mingle. Want to write a rap song? Let's go.
- 📫 How to reach me -- I'm hesitant to put my personal details out there, so reach me on my oft neglected Twitter: @neasbitt_jenny
